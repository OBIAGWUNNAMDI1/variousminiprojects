#  Sample Hardhat Project

This project demostrates how to write a contract that has a struct, a function (struct as input) which assigns values to a struct. The event emits a struct.

A function that returns the struct with a key.

The project comes with a sample contract that has two functions, one that sets a struct and gets a struct, a script that deploys the contract.
